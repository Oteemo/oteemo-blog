# Merge into main is not required

Gitlab doesn't have free  pull mirroring, so there's no point in merging into
main bc gitlab won't see the changes. I'll leave these changes on this branch
so they're here for reference. But they'll only do things when committed
directly to the Gitlab repo. Unless I get Gitlab premium lol. Then a merge
would be worth it.
